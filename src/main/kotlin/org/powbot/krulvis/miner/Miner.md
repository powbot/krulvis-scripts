## Motherlode mine

If you want to use the upper level in the motherlode mine, just walk up the ladder and after you're standing up there "
Interact with GameObjects" to make a selection of veins on the upper level that you want to mine.

## Adding new rocks

If the rock you want to mine does not work, please run 'krul ColorFinder' and stand in front of the rock while facing
it. There should be a modColor field with a number changing when you mine the rock. Please send me a screenshot with the
info while the rock is mineable.
